Queue Management System
In a conventional bank branch, long queues are a common sighting and they are a measure of a bank’s quality of service and their commitment towards making the customer experience more favourable. Queuing remains a pain point for customers and bank employees even after years of constant innovation and improvement in the banking services. From ATMs to AI powered helpdesks; the banking experience has gone through a number of changes over the past few decades.

With the constant and brutal competition between banks for a share of the customers’ wallet, an efficient solution to the long queues will give an edge to any bank. Our solution is an automated queue management system for retail banking customers to reduce queue lengths, increase staff productivity and overall efficiency of the branch.

We have chosen three scenarios as per our research and domain knowledge, which would be best suited for Queue Automation and Management.

NEFT / RTGS Transfer
Loan Applications

2.1. Education Loan
2.2. Gold Loan
Cheque Clearing

Let’s take an example of a conventional NEFT / RTGS Transfer:

NEFT / RTGS Transactions are availed offline, mainly, by customers who are reluctant to use the service online on account of the likely threat of fraud.

Here are the steps for a walk-in customer to make an NEFT/RTGS Transfer: 1. Collect an application form from the branch or download one online. 2. Fill the form with details and make sure you have copies of any required documents (if any) like ID proof, cheque leaflet etc. 3. Find a Counter which is not always properly labelled or understood by customers which handles fund transfers and get in the queue. 4. Wait for your turn with no estimated wait time. Customers also have to stand in queue physically for a long time before their turn comes. Customers often find they have made a mistake with the form or are missing some required documents. They might have to restart in the queue or disturb the queue when they return with the required documents. 5. Get the application processed, collect receipt of transfer. 6. Transaction is now complete.

Let's go through the same task but with our Queue Management System - qU:

Scan QR Code at branch entry (to connect to the bank network)
Sign Up and Sign In for new and existing users for the branch respectively using Mobile Number as User ID. Sign Up is OTP based.
Choose NEFT/RTGS transfer. A ticket is generated under NEFT/RTGS Transfer Section. The ticketing system is on the local network.
Choose between Fill Form Now or Upload pre-filled form.
For pre-filled form

5.1. Upload filled application form
5.2. Ticket is generated after some validation of uploaded form and scheduling begins for ticket.
5.3. Customer is assigned a counter number and an estimated waiting time (based on past data).
For Fill Form Now

6.1. Customer fills the form on the web application. 
6.2. Ticket is generated after some validation of form data and scheduling begins for ticket.
6.3. Customer is assigned a counter number and an estimated waiting time (based on past data).
Customer can wait in the waiting area or go out and return to the bank when his/her turn comes.

Customer tickets are discarded if they are unable to reach to a counter within 2-3 mins after the wait time.
The bank employee at the designated counter can view the uploaded or filled form associated with the ticket number on his/her system. He/she verifies the details of the transfer and processes the request.
Customer collects the receipt of the transfer.
As you can see, this process is much more streamlined, customer-friendly and well monitored than the conventional bank queues.
